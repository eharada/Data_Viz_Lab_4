The following data visualizations were created for prospective MSIS students and recruiters to see how Santa Clara ranks amongst the other California colleges and what you can expect when you graduate. In the visuals, we can see that MSIS Students learn technical skills that allow them to work at well-known companies that pay higher salaries.

## First Visual: How does Santa Clara University rank amongst the California colleges?

SCU is ranked top 10 out of 55 colleges in California. This shows how SCU is a credible school and is pretty close to well-known schools such as Cal (Berkeley) or UCLA. This ranking is focused more on return on investment in which students can more easily earn back the money spent for their tuition. Because the ROI is on the higher end and the location is in Silicon Valley, Santa Clara University is a great school. <br/><br/>

Advantage: This is a small list that shows you what each school's rankings are. It's easy for the reader to find SCU in the list and compare against colleges in the same state. <br/>
Disadvantage: It would be better to see how SCU ranks out of all US colleges and maybe even to compare them against other private universities. Prospective students may be opened to any college in the United States, so they'll want more information.

## Second Visual: What skills do MSIS graduates posses?

The majority of MSIS graduates learn highly sought after technical skills such as SQL, Java and Data Analysis. This is attractive to recruiters as they can see that MSIS students have the skills that their companies are looking for. Recruiters can focus their attention on hiring MSIS students for technical roles that might otherwise be hard to fill. <br/><br/>

Advantage: This chart shows the order of the skills that most people have. This chart is in line with the curriculum that MSIS students will go through. <br/>
Disadvantage: It would be nice to see the skills that recruiters are searching for and compare that against this chart. With that data, we would be able to see how many skills a MSIS student will possess and how many skills they will have to learn on their own.


## Third Visual: How Data Analyst salaries compare across companies?

In the MSIS program you develop the skills to become a Data Analyst. For this type of role, you can see the average salary is around $76,000. Students can expect to earn at least $64,000 (which is the lower end of the salary) and at most $96,000 (which is the higher end of the salary).<br/><br/>

Advantage: You can see the rankings for the companies that pay on the higher end. Prospective students can use this to focus on certain companies if salary is one of their top criteria. <br/>
Disadvantage: It would be better to see the average salary for any analyst position and then compare that against Data Analysts to see if they are paid more than Financial Analysts, Operations Analysts, etc. If we see that it's higher then we know that this program is worthwhile.
<br/><br/>


### Conclusion: Prospective students should definitely go to Santa Clara University and more specifically enroll in the MSIS program. Santa Clara University is reputable and ranks amongst the top 10 universities in California. In the MSIS program, you learn technical skills that are in high demand. Because of this, you are able to obtain higher paying jobs and are able to see a higher return on investment.
